"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides candidate details and a target job.
Write a professional, ATS-friendly resume tailored to the target role.

First, produce a concise 2–4 bullet **Plan** that lists the sections and focus points you will include (e.g., highlight leadership, quantify achievements, include keywords from job description). Do not reveal internal chain-of-thought — keep the plan explicit and short.

Then generate the resume. Use clear section headers (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects/Certs as applicable). For experience bullets, use the STAR/impact style (situation/task → action → measurable result) and include quantifiable metrics where possible. Tailor language and keywords to the target job.

### Candidate details / Job target:
Position: 13 years of exp || Solidity, C#, JavaScript || CTO / VP / Tech Lead Full stack
More info: Who am I:
- 13 years of commercial experience as a software engineer (web projects, customers from Europe and US);
- 5 years in roles of team lead, tech lead, architect (including coding);
- constant learner (books, courses, youtube);
- C1 (Advanced) level of English (IELTS General = 7/9);
- tech languages: C#, JavaScript, Solidity;
- ready to learn Rust/Go.

What can I bring in:
- develop your web/blockchain project from gathering requirements stage to deployment and maintenance;
- build a team of highly qualified and responsible professionals;
- build processes or improve existing ones;
- design architectures, code features, perform code reviews and so on.

What can I technically (in short):
- С#: 12 years of exp; .Net Core, .Net 6, MS SQL, EF, Clean Architecture, anything related to web platforms;
- JavaScript: 7 years of exp; Node.js, React.js, Angular;
- Solidity: since March 2021; upgradeable, secure, metamorphic, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, EIP1967, diamonds, proxies, clones, beacons, play-to-earn, vulnerabilities, on-chain/off-chain data storage, oracles, push/pull, tests, deployment, Truffle, Hardhat, Ganache, Mocha, Chai, web3.js, ether.js, OpenZeppelin, IPFS;
- Databases: MS SQL (and any relational), NoSQL (MongoDB);
- CI/CD: GitLab, TeamCity, BitBucket, Azure CI/CD Pipelines, GitHub Actions.
Looking For: I am interested in:
- part-time engagement;
- blockchain projects (DeFi, NFT, Gaming, Metaverse);
- high salary (I apply to jobs paid $120+ per hour);
- roles of a researcher and/or a leader rather than just coder;
- ability to work remotely from Bali (with that said, I'm ok with visiting office during initial months to earn your respect and trust);
- freedom in taking decisions;
- time zone of Europe or Asia;
- 1-2 interviews as a max, with tech specialists and managers.

I am not interested in:
- US time zone (I'd prefer morning shifts starting at 7am rather than coding till midnight);
- strict ""fabric"" schedule like ""9-to-6"", ""10-to-7"", ""11-to-8"" and so on (since in IT this is an indicator of the unprofessional nature of the team and management);
- jobs with a requirement of overall experience in software development of just a few years (I have 12, and the job offered should be my next challenge);
- calls with HRs for ""just to have a 30 minutes blah-blah-blah"" (I have a prepared list of questions, and I hope you have prepared too);
- if I have no word from you at any of the stages for more than a week - I am not more interested in the job;
- I may consider test tasks only for tech lead or CTO roles, and it should be prepaid (for free you may have a look at my github and linkedin).
